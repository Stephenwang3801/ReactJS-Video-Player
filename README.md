# ReactJS-Video-Player

Welcome! This is an online video streaming application I built as I learned ReactJS. I wanted to take my JavaScript learning to the next level and gain experience with the ReactJS frontend framework. Using the Youtube Data API, the application can search and playback videos online. The project is deployed here using netlify: https://reactjs-video-player.netlify.app/

Through building this project, I learned:

- How to properly structure and develop a modular React Application
- The usage of Material UI's Grid, Typography, Textfield, Paper, etc. to layout the interface.
- Using asynchronous Javascript and APIs to fetch data
- Dataflow and the managing of states in React
- Passing of props between parent and child components
